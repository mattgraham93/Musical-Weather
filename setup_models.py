    need to:
    - reach out and store the weather data
    - if first time, store the data in a database
    - create ability to get forecast data
    - store the forecast data for that day
    - observe how the weather event scores within its t-scores
    
    - create model and predict weather event
    
    - return the results to the music algorithm
    - with the weather event, get range of scores for that event in relation to how it scores in the music algorithm (t-score)
    
    - return selection of songs within 2 standard deviations of the mean weather event score
    
    nice to haves:
    - stuff from last.fm (seattle stuff)
    - anything outside of weather events (seasons)
    - ability to select a city
